Description: Many modern C/C++ development tools in the clang/LLVM toolchain,
  such as clang-tidy or clangd, rely on the presence of a compilation database
  in JSON format <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html>.
  This package temporarily injects additional build flags into the R build
  process to generate such a compilation database.
