Many modern C++ development tools in the clang/LLVM toolchain, such
as clang-tidy or clangd, rely on the presence of a [compilation database in
JSON format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).
This package temporarily injects additional build flags into the R build
process to generate such a compilation database.

## Caveats

1. A full package build including compilation is necessary to generate the
   compilation database.
2. Currently, this method only works for packages utilizing the standard R
   build process, i.e. the only modifications to the build process come in
   the form of `Makevars`/`Makevars.win`/`Makevars.ucrt`, or the configurable
   variant `Makevars.in`, in the package's `src` directory. This supports a
   broad range of packages since it allows for custom `configure` files as
   long as they do not create a `Makevars` file from scratch but rather
   modify a `Makevars.in`.

   For packages using their own custom `Makefile`s, additional effort from the
   package authors side may be necessary to generate the compilation database(s).

## Installation

You can install the development version of compdb like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("cyianor/compdb")
```

## Example

Using this package is simple and only requires a call to
``` r
build_compile_commands(path = ".")
```
where `path` should point to the packages base path. It will produce a
file called `compile_commands.json` in the package's `src/` directory.

## How it works

The package at `path` is built as a source package to a temporary location.
If the package already contains a `Makevars` (or `Makevars.win`/`Makevars.ucrt`)
file, it is modified at the temporary location to include
`PKG_CPPFLAGS += -MJ \@.json` which will prompt `clang` to generate a
compilation database for each file it processes.
The package is then installed to a temporary location which triggers
compilation of all source files and thereby generates the
compilation databases.

Finally, the compilation databases are merged and the directory of each file
in the compilation database is corrected from the temporary directory to
the actual package directory.

## Inspiration

This package is essentially a re-implementation of the bash script at
[ashiklom/rcpp-cmpdb](https://github.com/ashiklom/rcpp-cmpdb) with additional
bells and whistles.
